# 🧬 Panic Rhythm Engine 🛡️

**Panic Rhythm** is a novel safety algorithm designed to bridge the gap between human physiology and mobile technology. 

### 💡 The Vision
In extreme danger, the human body undergoes a 'Fight or Flight' response, releasing adrenaline which causes **Micro-Tremors** (8-12 Hz). This project uses smartphone sensors to detect these biological signatures autonomously.

### 🛠️ Core Features
- **Gait Analysis:** Detects sudden changes in walking patterns (Brisk walking/Running).
- **Tremor Sensing:** Uses the Accelerometer to filter high-frequency panic vibrations.
- **Silent Trigger:** No button press required; the body's response is the trigger.

### 🧪 Academic Background
Developed by **Srishti**, a BS-MS student at **IIT Patna** (CS & Data Analytics) and BSc Biology student at **Lucknow University**.
